# TimeSeriesProjectPowerConsumption

The goal of this project is to analyze the household power consumption data to forecast the individual household electric power consumption using the naive base methods and advanced statistical techniques.

- Part 1:

In this part the power consumption data is read and from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption.
The data is cleaned, feature processing is applied, and anomaly existance is checked in the  dataset.

Historical Mean and Last Known Value are the two na√Øve time-series forecasting techniques to set a benchmark for the analysis.

ARIMA, SARIMAX are the two advanced statistical time-series forecasting techniques used to compare the performance of the forecasting techniques over the benchmark results.  


- Part 2:

The following deep learning techniques are used to test the forecasting performance of the dataset:
o	MILP
o	CNN
o	LSTM
o	CNN+LSTM
o	AR-LSTM
